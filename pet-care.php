                <h2>How Much Exercise Does a Puppy Need ?</h2>
                <!-- <img src="/img/tommy.jpg" alt="Claire" style="width:100%"> -->
                <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
                <p>0-4 weeks – At this age, it is recommended that puppies should not be subjected to any type of routine or forced exercise.
                    It would be best to leave the puppy alone so he can control his own pace. Usually, a puppy will choose to play around and then
                    stop when he gets tired. This play-and-rest style is very important to protect your puppy from overworking his joints and ligaments.
                    Since they muscles are also not yet that developed, they will not be able to withstand prolonged physical exercise.
                    Your puppy will be spending a lot of time sleeping at this age. You will also notice that when you try to walk him farther
                    away from his kennel or from your home, he will resist the pull. This is due to the fact that your puppy is still
                    feeling his way around his territory and taking him away from it will scare and even confuse him.
                </p>
                <p>13 weeks – 6 months – At this stage, your puppy will have greater resilience to physical activities and you may mistake
                    this as a sign that your puppy can now do a lot of physical training or exercise.But a word of caution here:
                    your puppy’s growth plates and ligaments are still tender and prone to damage so it would be wise if you can let them
                    do their own thing. At six months old, they can now spend a maximum of 30 minutes of either leash walking or even
                    a bit of jogging around the block. You can divide this into two sessions containing 15 minutes each during the morning
                    and the afternoon before they go to bed.
                </p>
                <p>7 – 10 months – Your puppy will now be almost full-grown and they can now engage in longer exercises but the key here is to
                    never engage them in heavy impact activities such as jumping or even climbing up stairs. The growth plates may still be in their
                    developmental stage and engaging them in heavy or exhausting activities can damage their joints. When this happens, the bones
                    will continue to grow longer but the growth plates will stop developing which can lead to a bow-leg or hip dysplasia.
                    The best types of activities to engage your puppy in will include swimming as it is a low-impact activity and will do no
                    damage to joints

                <h2>Nutrition</h2>
                <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
                <p>Dog food is usually wet or dry. Dry dog food is generally more available, affordable and easier to store.
                    It does not require refrigeration and contain approximately 90% dry ingredients and 10% water. Dry dog food is more easily
                    digestible compared to wet dog food because it is made by combining ingredients like meat and grain.
                </p>
                <p>When choosing a dry dog food it is important to know about your senior dog’s nutritional needs and dietary requirements.
                    Generally speaking, higher quality senior dog food contains the appropriate amount of vitamins and minerals needed at
                    this stage in his life..

                <h2>What Are The Benefits Of a Good Puppy Exercise ?</h2>
                <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
                <p>It helps to develop their bones and muscles. – Physical activities help to build up a puppy’s muscle and bone density but
                    the wrong ones can destroy them. It is therefore important not to force them to go beyond their capacity. Your puppy’s
                    bones will ossify or harden once they reach the age of adulthood.
                </p>
                <p>It helps to expend their stored up energy and thus prevent destructive activities. – When your puppy has properly expended
                    their energies, they will be calmer and will be able to go to sleep much faster. A puppy that has a lot of stored energy in
                    him will be howling, barking, scratching and annoying their owners during the night. These are also the reasons why puppies
                    tend to destroy things when they are left to themselves at home.
                </p>
                <p>It helps to socialize your puppy. — Allowing your puppy to engage with other puppies or meet other people while walking
                    them will help them become friendlier and easier to handle when in public areas. This puts a lot less risk of them
                    being aggressive and of biting other people or dogs that they would meet as they grow older. Dogs which have been kept
                    away from social interaction during their puppyhood are a lot more prone to aggressive behavior when they grow up.
                    We have tips on how to let your puppy socialize that can help you.
                </p>
                <p>It serves as a way of “bonding” with your dog. – You will get to spend a lot of time establishing that “bond” with your
                    dog while they are still puppies by these exercises. The playtime and walking-around-the-block routine can help establish
                    your relationship with your dog and will help strengthen that identity as time goes on. This is very helpful especially
                    if you need to establish a lot of control in your dog as they grow older. This specifically true for large and giant breeds
                    that will need a lot of owner control when they fully mature.

                <h2>Common health problems and illnesses</h2>
                <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
                <p>Huskies do have their share of health issues, which is why it’s a good idea to take out insurance for your Husky while they’re still a puppy.</p>
                <p>While a Husky’s long, floppy ears play a large part in what makes this breed so loveable, they can create issues when the airflow
                    is blocked to the ear canal and moisture becomes trapped inside. When this occurs, infection is likely to develop,
                    and your Husky will need a course of antibiotics to prevent any long-term problems developing.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Arthritis is very common amongst older dogs. In fact, 1 in 5 Australian dogs suffer from arthritis, or osteoarthritis as it is known,
                    at some point during their lives. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> You’ll notice that your dog is slower to get onto their feet (especially in the morning
                        or in cooler weather) and will be far less active than they used to be. It’s often very hard to tell if your dog is suffering
                        from arthritis. Even though it’s very painful, your dog won’t show much sign of complaint. Exercise, weight control and
                        anti-arthritic drugs can all lead to helping your dog overcome the pain of arthritis.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, just like us, dogs will often develop cancers as they get older and their bodies begin to show their age.
                    Dogs can suffer from all the types of cancers we do, such as lymphoma, melanoma, breast cancer and even prostate cancer to name a few.
                    <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> Treating cancer can take the form of surgeries, chemotherapy or radiation treatment.
                        Like all cancers, catching it early is the most important thing, so look out for any unusual lumps or spots on your dog’s skin,

                <p>Kennel cough is very common amongst dogs that have been at the animal shelter, vet or in pet accommodation.
                    Unfortunately it’s not something that can really be avoided and in reality, although kennel cough can sound bad,
                    it’s equivalent to the common cold for us. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> The best way to look after your
                        pet with kennel cough is to give them rest and plenty of good food and water. You may be given antibiotics by your vet
                        to knock it over if your dog’s case is particularly severe. Check out our Kennel Cough profile for more information
